## whoami

Hello! I'm **Seckin**, a passionate DevOps Engineer with a deep love for automation, cloud infrastructure, and the art of turning complex problems into elegant, scalable solutions. Welcome to my digital workspace where I share my journey through the ever-evolving landscape of technology.

## ./background.sh

My journey in technology began with a curiosity about how systems work and a desire to make them work better. Over the years, I've evolved from understanding individual components to orchestrating entire ecosystems of applications, infrastructure, and processes.

I believe in the philosophy of **"Infrastructure as Code"** and **"Everything as Code"** - treating infrastructure, configurations, and processes with the same discipline and version control as application code. This approach has allowed me to build resilient, scalable, and maintainable systems that can adapt to changing business needs.

### Key Achievements

- **Cloud Migration Leadership**: Successfully led multiple large-scale cloud migration projects, reducing infrastructure costs by 40% while improving system reliability and performance.

- **Automation Framework Development**: Built comprehensive CI/CD pipelines that reduced deployment time from hours to minutes, enabling teams to deploy multiple times per day with confidence.

- **Monitoring & Observability**: Implemented end-to-end monitoring solutions that improved system visibility and reduced mean time to resolution (MTTR) by 60%.

- **Security Integration**: Integrated security practices into the development lifecycle, implementing automated security scanning and compliance checks that caught vulnerabilities early in the development process.

# My DevOps Philosophy

1. **Automate Everything**: If you do it more than twice, automate it.
2. **Fail Fast, Learn Faster**: Embrace failure as a learning opportunity.
3. **Measure Everything**: You can't improve what you don't measure.
4. **Security First**: Security is not an afterthought, it's a foundation.
5. **Continuous Learning**: Technology evolves rapidly; so should we.
6. **Collaboration Over Silos**: Break down barriers between teams.
7. **Infrastructure as Code**: Treat infrastructure with the same discipline as application code.
```

## ./current_focus.sh --status

Currently, I'm diving deep into:

- **Kubernetes Ecosystem**: Exploring advanced patterns with service mesh, operators, and GitOps workflows
- **Cloud-Native Security**: Implementing zero-trust architectures and runtime security monitoring
- **Platform Engineering**: Building internal developer platforms that improve developer experience and productivity
- **Observability**: Advanced monitoring, tracing, and logging strategies for distributed systems
- **Sustainability**: Green computing practices and optimizing cloud resource usage for environmental impact
