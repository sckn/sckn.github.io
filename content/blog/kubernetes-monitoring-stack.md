# Building a Complete Kubernetes Monitoring Stack

Monitoring is crucial for maintaining healthy Kubernetes clusters. In this post, we'll build a complete monitoring stack using Prometheus, Grafana, and AlertManager.

## Why Monitoring Matters

In a microservices architecture running on Kubernetes, observability becomes critical. Without proper monitoring, you're flying blind when issues arise.

## The Stack Components

### Prometheus
Prometheus serves as our metrics collection and storage engine. It scrapes metrics from various endpoints and stores them in a time-series database.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: prometheus
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: prometheus
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: prometheus
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: prometheus
        image: prom/prometheus:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 9090
```

### Grafana
Grafana provides beautiful dashboards and visualization for our metrics.

### AlertManager
AlertManager handles alerts sent by Prometheus and routes them to the appropriate channels.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Deploy Prometheus Operator**
2. **Configure ServiceMonitors**
3. **Set up Grafana dashboards**
4. **Configure alerting rules**

## Best Practices

- Use resource limits and requests
- Implement proper RBAC
- Set up persistent storage
- Configure backup strategies

## Conclusion

A well-configured monitoring stack is essential for production Kubernetes environments. This setup provides the foundation for observability and proactive issue resolution.
