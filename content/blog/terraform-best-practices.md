# Terraform Best Practices for Production Infrastructure

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform has revolutionized how we manage cloud resources. Here are the essential practices I've learned from managing production infrastructure.

## State Management

### Remote State Storage
Always use remote state storage for production environments:

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "my-terraform-state"
    key    = "production/terraform.tfstate"
    region = "us-west-2"
    
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-locks"
    encrypt        = true
  }
}
```

### State Locking
Use DynamoDB for state locking to prevent concurrent modifications.

## Module Organization

### Directory Structure
```
terraform/
├── modules/
│   ├── vpc/
│   ├── eks/
│   └── rds/
├── environments/
│   ├── dev/
│   ├── staging/
│   └── prod/
└── shared/
```

### Module Versioning
Pin module versions to ensure reproducible deployments:

```hcl
module "vpc" {
  source  = "terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws"
  version = "~> 3.0"
  
  name = var.vpc_name
  cidr = var.vpc_cidr
}
```

## Security Practices

1. **Never commit secrets to version control**
2. **Use IAM roles instead of access keys**
3. **Enable CloudTrail for audit logging**
4. **Implement least privilege access**

## Testing Strategy

- Use `terraform plan` before every apply
- Implement automated testing with Terratest
- Use `terraform validate` in CI/CD pipelines
- Regular `terraform fmt` checks

## Conclusion

Following these practices will help you build maintainable, secure, and scalable infrastructure with Terraform.
