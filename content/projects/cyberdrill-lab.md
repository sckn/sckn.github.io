# CyberDrill Lab

An automated cybersecurity training environment that provides hands-on experience with real-world security scenarios using containerized vulnerable applications.

<!--more-->

## Overview

CyberDrill Lab creates isolated, reproducible cybersecurity training environments using Docker containers. It's designed for security professionals, students, and anyone looking to improve their penetration testing and vulnerability assessment skills.

## Features

### Automated Environment Setup
- **One-click deployment** of vulnerable applications
- **Network isolation** for safe testing
- **Automated cleanup** after training sessions
- **Resource monitoring** and management

### Vulnerability Scenarios
- **Web Application Security**: OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
- **Network Security**: Misconfigurations and weak protocols
- **Container Security**: Docker escape techniques
- **Infrastructure Security**: Cloud misconfigurations

### Training Modules
1. **SQL Injection Labs**
2. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
3. **Authentication Bypass**
4. **Privilege Escalation**
5. **Container Breakouts**

## Architecture

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# cyberdrill.sh - Main deployment script

deploy_lab() {
    local scenario=$1
    
    echo "ðŸš€ Deploying CyberDrill Lab: $scenario"
    
    # Create isolated network
    docker network create cyberdrill-net
    
    # Deploy vulnerable applications
    docker-compose -f scenarios/$scenario/docker-compose.yml up -d
    
    # Setup monitoring
    deploy_monitoring
    
    echo "âœ… Lab environment ready!"
}
```

## Supported Scenarios

### Web Application Security
- **DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application)**
- **WebGoat**: OWASP's training application
- **Mutillidae**: Deliberately vulnerable web application
- **bWAPP**: Buggy web application

### Network Security
- **Metasploitable**: Intentionally vulnerable Linux distribution
- **VulnHub VMs**: Various vulnerable virtual machines
- **Custom network scenarios**: Misconfigured services

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/sckn/cyberdrill-lab.git
cd cyberdrill-lab

# Deploy a web security lab
./cyberdrill.sh deploy web-security

# List available scenarios
./cyberdrill.sh list

# Clean up environment
./cyberdrill.sh cleanup
```

## Configuration

```yaml
# config/lab-config.yml
lab:
  network_range: "172.20.0.0/16"
  auto_cleanup: true
  session_timeout: "4h"
  
scenarios:
  web-security:
    containers: ["dvwa", "webgoat", "juice-shop"]
    ports: ["8080", "8081", "3000"]
    
  network-security:
    containers: ["metasploitable", "vulnerable-ssh"]
    network_mode: "bridge"
```

## Security Features

- **Isolated Networks**: Each lab runs in its own Docker network
- **Resource Limits**: CPU and memory constraints prevent system overload
- **Auto-cleanup**: Automatic environment teardown after sessions
- **Logging**: Comprehensive activity logging for analysis

## Educational Value

### Learning Objectives
- Understand common vulnerability patterns
- Practice exploitation techniques safely
